<h3>GPSLogger Flight</h3>
<div>
    The software is designed to record the geographical position of your smartphone
    using GPS, GLONASS, etc. (depending on the support of these systems by the smartphone).
    It is also possible to use positioning data from GPRS / 3G antennas
    and Wi-Fi access points (however, such approach is not recommended due to the fairly low accuracy of the data).
    The data is saved in the files of the GPSLogger folder located in the root of smartphone's SD card
    (real or virtual - depending on smartphone). The following file formats are supported: KML, IGC, GPX, TXT.
    Also, the geolocation data can be sent to other servers using different Internet protocols.
    Such sending is possible at the time of track recording or at the end of the recording.
    It is possible to send the geolocation data using the following methods:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Real-time tracking to OpenGTS, Livetrack24, SkyLines servers (it's possible to send each point separately,
            or by groups - to optimize the battery consumption);
        </li>
        <li>
            Periodic sending of track file by e-mail;
        </li>
        <li>
            Periodic upload of track file by FTP protocol;
        </li>
        <li>
            Periodic upload of track file to the DropBox server;
        </li>
        <li>
            Periodic upload of track file to the OpenStreetMaps server.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Additionally, it is possible to send coordinates and track files in manual mode, using any software
    available on the smartphone, which supports sending data in text format or sending files (SMS, WhatsApp, GMail, Viber, etc.).
</div>
<div>
    GPSLogger Flight software works on smartphones and tablets with Android operating system installed.
    Minimal version of Android, where the software runs - 2.3.3. Minimal version where the software is supported - 4.4.4.
    The software neither needs nor uses Google Services. When you start GPSLogger Flight for the first time,
    geolocation services access permissions and SD memory card access permissions are requested.
    These permissions are <b>absolutely indispensable</b> for normal operation of the software.
    Additionally the software needs to access files attached to e-mails to directly import the configuration from the mails.
</div>
<div>
    The software GPSLogger Flight provides many personal settings, almost all recording parameters
    and live tracking parameters can be customized. Configuration settings can be saved to a text file with the CSV extension.
    This file can be easily modified in a text editor or spreadsheet editing software (for example, Excel).
    GPSLogger Flight supports importing data from CSV file placed in smartphone's file system
    (in case of presence of a file explorer), attached to an e-mail or placed directly into the GPSLogger folder
    in the root of SD card (real or virtual - depending on smartphone).
</div>
<div>
    GPSLogger Flight software is optimized to work together with the OpenGTS server
    available on <a href="https://gts.flytrace.com/">flytrace.com</a>.
    After a registration on the site, an e-mail with the configuration file already prepared and optimized for this service
    will be sent to an address used for the registration. Importing the file into the software allows you to
    immediately start the tracking without having to enter all the parameters manually.
    Using GPSLogger Flight with other OpenGTS servers is possible, but requires manual configuration, some problems
    could be observed in this case car altitude information is not processed by OpenGTS servers by default.
</div>
<div>
    There are two modes of operation of the settings part in the GPSLogger Flight software - simple and advanced.
    The <i>Preference Mode</i> menu item placed on the main screen of <i>Settings</i>
    screen (<i>Menu -&gt; Settings</i>) is provided to be able to change the mode.
    On the same screen, you can directly access the <i>Location</i> section Android system settings.
    In the advanced mode of settings management on the same screen one can activate/deactivate the following parameters:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <b> Log to GPX / KML / IGC / TXT files </b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b> Log to OpenGTS / SkyLines / Livetrack24 servers (live-tracking) </b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    Also, from this screen you can access the following settings management screens:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>General Options;</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Logging Details</b> (used for tracking to files, and for live-tracking);
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Live tracker settings</b> - common settings for live-tracking and access
            to configuration screens of supported live-tracking servers - OpenGTS, SkyLines, Livetrack24;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Auto Send Settings</b> - common settings for automatic sending of track files
            and access to configuration screens of the E-Mail, FTP, Dropbox, OpenStreetMaps servers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Personal Data</b> - these data are used when saving tracks to IGC files;
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    The <i>General Options</i> screen can be used to change the following settings:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Use modular display</b> - use an alternative interface with the information
            about speed, altitude, finesse and direction of movement readable easily.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Force screen on</b>. Enabling this option avoids
            the automatic turning off of the screen.
            Activating this mode dramatically increases energy consumption.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Start on bootup</b>. This option activates the automatic startup of the application
            and launching GPS track logging when the system boots.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Use Imperial units</b> - activates the use of feets, miles etc. as units of measurement
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Message template</b>. When the coordinates are sent in a text messages (e-mail, SMS, WhatsApp, etc.)
            the message format can be customized (for example, to send a link to the location on the Google Maps or Mappy).
            The message template serves for this. In the text, you can use some special variables that will be replaced
            by GPS coordinates in different formats. The following variables are available:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>LATDD</i> - The latitude, decimal degrees
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LONDD</i> - The longitude, decimal degrees
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LATD</i> - The latitude, integer degrees
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LOND</i> - The longitude, integer degrees
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LATM</i> - The latitude, integer minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LONM</i> - The longitude, integer minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LATS</i> - The latitude, integer seconds
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LONS</i> - The longitude, integer seconds
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LATMD</i> - The latitude, decimal minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LONMD</i> - The longitude, decimal minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LATSD</i> - The latitude, decimal seconds
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>LONSD</i> - The longitude, decimal seconds
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>TS</i> - The timestamp (hours, minutes, seconds).
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            <b>Write to debug file</b>. When this setting is enabled, the software
            writes a lot of debug information to the file <i>debug.log</i>,
            placed in the GPSLogger folder located at the
            root of the SD card (real or virtual - depending on smartphone).
            This file must be sent to the developers in case of sending
            information about the error in the software.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    The <i>Logging details</i> screen can be used to change the following settings:
    <ul>
        <li><b>New file creation</b>. The software can save the traces in the same file
            or create a new file - once a day or each time the trcking is started
            (when you press the <i>Start Logging</i> button on the main screen).
            By default, the file name used is the date and time of the tracking start
            but in the case of writing into the same file, the file name can be specified.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Prefer celltowers</b>. This option disables using of GPS
            and forces using of celltowers and/or Wi-Fi access points to obtain coordinates.
            This optionis is not recommended because the coordinate accuracy in this mode is very low.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Time before logging</b>. This time defines the frequency of GPS position recording in file(s).
            Minimum possible value - 1 second. It is not recommended to use an interval of less than 5 seconds
            because this causes very fast battery discharge.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Keep GPS on between fixes</b>. This parameter determines the behavior
            of service - turn the GPS on or off while waiting for next tracking point.
            Due to additional charges related to GPS activation/deactivation
            it is not recommended to turn off GPS in case of the tracking interval
            set in some seconds or minutes. It is useful to disable GPS only
            if the tracking interval is set in tens of minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Distance before logging</b>. This parameter sets the minimum value
            for geographical position change for logging of a point.
            In case of absence of position change for the distance greater than this value
            the new point will be ignored. It is recommended to set this parameter
            to few meters to avoid recording multiple points
            in case of absence of movement. Due to the fact that
            GPS position precision is normally few meters, it is recommended to
            set this parameter between 3 and 6 meters.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Accuracy before logging</b>. This parameter determines the minimum
            accuracy of GPS position measurement considered as valid for recording a
            point. In case of the accuracy is below - the point will be ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Time interval for accuracy</b>. In case of the GPS position accuracy
            is less than the required for logging - the program waits an improvement
            of the accuracy during this time. Use 0 to not wait.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Critical Battery Level</b>. Despite all the optimizations,
            GPS tracking drains the battery rather quickly, mostly on old
            Smartphone models, equipped by GPS modules consuming a lot of energy.
            To avoid a full discharge of the smartphone this parameter can be used.
            The software stops tracking when the battery level reaches the specified value.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    The <b>Live-tracker settings</b> screen allows you to access the settings of different
    types of servers - OpenGTS, SkyLines, Livetrack24. Additionally, the following options,
    valid for all types of live-tracking servers, are available:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Send points by group</b>.
            If this parameter is greater than 1 the software tries to connect to the live-tracking
            server and send the coordinates only when the number of points saved
            in the internal memory buffer is greater than the given value.
            For example, when the GPS position tracking period
            is set to 2 minutes, and <b>Send points by group</b> is set to 5 the program starts the
            connection to the server once in 10 minutes,
            in each session 5 coordinate points will be sent, the GPS positions
            will be saved with a difference of 2 minutes. Such approach
            saves the battery of the smartphone, however
            the relevance of the GPS position on the server
            live-tracking will be worse than in the case of normal sending.
        </li>
        <li><b>Offline buffer size</b>.
            This parameter sets the size of memory buffer
            to store the GPS position points when
            the connection to the live-tracking server is impossible
            (or when sending points by group is activated).
            As soon as the connection is restored (or when the number of points needed
            in the buffer is reached) the points will be sent to the server.
            In case of long absence of communication with the server and
            full buffer, old points will be removed to make room for the new data.
            Setting this parameter to too high values ​​can cause
            the lack of memory of the smartphone and can crash the software. However, on
            powerful smartphones with a lot of RAM, this setting can be increased
            to avoid losing points during long absense of
            communication with the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Max wait time</b> et
            <b>Max wait cycles</b>.
            These two parameters define the conditions
            to restart service of the application in case of abnormal situation
            (often related to Android operating system errors).
            If since the specified time (in seconds) or since
            specified number of points write cycles
            the system is not trying to send the
            points to the live-tracking server - the service will be
            restarted. Normally, this restart unlocks the tracking.
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div>
    The <b>Auto send, email and upload</b> screen allows you to change the following settings:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Enable/Disable automatic sending of files</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Frequency of sending</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Send zip file</b>. When this setting is active - the files will
            be archived before sending.	As all file formats,
            supported by the software, are text-based  - file archiving
            considerably reduces the file size and, consequently, reduces
            traffic consumption and battery consumption. It is strongly recommended
            to keep this setting active.
        </li>
    </ul>
    Also, from this screen you can access the settings management screens
    for the following protocols, supported by GPSLogger Flight: Email,
    OpenStreetMaps, DropBox et FTP. In case of Email and FTP you should just
    specify the server settings, in case of OpenStreetMaps and DropBox you have
    to connect to the servers using your login/password because of using the OAuth protocol.
</div>
<div>
    For the security reasons IT IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED to use the principal E-Mail account
    to send the files. The E-Mail account password, specified in the GPSLogger Flight settings,
    is saved on your smartphone by Android OS without encryption, moreover if the preferences are exported
    the password is also exported as clear text and saved into a CSV file, placed into
    the GPSLogger folder of SD card. Therefore, all applications having access to the SD card,
    can access the login data of the E-Mail account. If the E-Mail protocol is planned
    for sending data - you have to register a specific account (on one of the
    public services - GMail, Yandex, ...) and use this account only for sending data by GPSLogger Flight.
